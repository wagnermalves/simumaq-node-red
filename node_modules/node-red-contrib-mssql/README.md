A node-red node for connecting to Microsoft MS SQL Databases
Based on npm package [mssql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mssql) 

Importantly, this package comes with pre-built linux drivers for communicating with the Azure & MS SQL services (using TDS protocal), removing the need to set-up environment level MSSQL (or similar) drivers.

Thanks to efa2000, creator of github.com/efa2000/node-red-contrib-odbc - who's node this was based on.
